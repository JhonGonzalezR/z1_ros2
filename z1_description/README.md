# Z1 Robot Description

This package contains the URDF and the meshes of the Z1 manipulator to work in ROS2.

Most of the files have been straight copies from the [official `unitree_ros`](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros/tree/8ebecd883a842a4631fcfa98933fae586aeb6709/robots/z1_description) repository, but have been modified to improve compliance with ROS2, particularly with the ROS2 control framework and the Ignition Simulator environment.
