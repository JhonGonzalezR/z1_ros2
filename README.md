# Unitree Z1 Hardware Interface

This package is an attempt to create the hardware interface for the [Z1 manipulator](https://shop.unitree.com/products/unitree-z1)
from Unitree.
The idea is to use their [sdk](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/z1_sdk) to create a
proper hardware interface for the [ROS2 control](https://control.ros.org/master/index.html)
library.
